        We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event
        experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression,
        sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance,
        body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other
        protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants
        in any form. We take violations of our policy seriously and will respond
        appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>All participants of our events must abide by the following policy:</p>

      <h6 class="text-bold text-3xl text-green-500">
        Be excellent to each other.
      </h6>
      <p>
        Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that
        everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our
        experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension,
        whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others.
        Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or
        about you.

      <h6 class="text-bold text-3xl text-red-500">
        Speak up if you see or hear something.
      </h6>

      <p>
        Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage
        when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel
        uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely
        bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.
